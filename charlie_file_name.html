    <div class="fs-4">AlphaFold is an AI system developed by Google DeepMind that predicts a
      proteinâ€™s 3D structure from its amino acid sequence. It regularly achieves accuracy competitive with experiment.
    </div>
    <div class="fs-5 "> In CASP14, AlphaFold was the top-ranked protein structure prediction method by a large margin,
      producing predictions with high accuracy. While the system still has some limitations, the CASP results suggest AlphaFold has immediate potential to help us understand the structure of proteins and advance biological research.</div>
