## Interest of content
Niche content was interesting, but some pages are unfinished.
## Visual Presentation
Same theme throughout with a strong landing page. Variation in the theme is cleanly executed.
## Quality of written presentation
Text contrast is high and easy to read. Good font choice and size. All pages are readable. Some minor spelling mistakes but few and far between.
## Validity of HTML
Some inconsistencies in links, and strange reordering of navbar components, but otherwise good HTML.
## Evidence of Collaboration
### Author info not written by author
Github/LinkedIn links not present on some pages, but author biographies clearly co-written (evidenced by blame). More clear commit messages will make it easier to find and evidence cooperation.
### Balanced Contributions
Commit history is balanced between all team members.
